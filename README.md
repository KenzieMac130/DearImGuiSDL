# DearImGuiSDL
 A collection of dear imgui goodies wrapped up in a nice and easy to initialize bow for simple SDL projects.
 
## Use case
I threw this together to serve as an easy to use jumping off point for those trying to learn basic computer graphics/game creation but are not yet comfortable diving into more complex graphics APIs.

## Why the uninspired naming?
Uhhh... It was the name of the folder on my computer.

## Is this tested and ready to use in production?
No, please don't!
